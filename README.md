## Folder containts: 

1. Houdini demo file with everything needed intacked, including cache
2. latest cache in the geo folder, but if it doesnt pick up, caching is fast enough for 200 frames
3. Video of the simulation, 200 frames
4. Emitter python code, the same as in the python node in houdini, just made into a file for readibiity. Works only in houdini
5. Solver python file, same as emitter, only works in houdini

Creates a Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics solver, implementing a method by MÃ¼ller, M. et al (2003) in [*Particle-based fluid simulation for interactive applications*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/846276.846298)
